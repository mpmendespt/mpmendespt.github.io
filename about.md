![me](/images/eu_4.jpg)
I was an electronics technician in the Portuguese Air Force. In this scope I worked in the maintenance of various systems including: 
Radio communications HF, VHF, MW (microwave); Multiplexing (TDM and PCM); Optical Fiber; Data communication networks (LAN); Subsystem of communications of the Portuguese Air Command and Control System (POACCS); Ground controlled approach (GCA); Tactical air navigation system (TACAN); Telephone exchanges (PBX), etc.

Also, I am an autodidact with an interest in many study areas.

This blog started as a test space for creating bloges in github.com using Jerkyll, </br>
now **Data Science and R** is a space where I publish some research issues about Data Science and R. But also, among others, posts discuss important events, current trends, book reviews, etc.
